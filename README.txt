Name of Game: Super Mario Matcher

Author: Colin Franceschini

Goal: The directions to the game are to match as many Super Mario characters in 30 seconds. 
		   The goal is to accumulate the highest score. The user can replay the game 
		   as many times as possible. The user can also exit the game or start a new 
		   game (which resets the timer and board). 

Scoring algorithm: Each pair of matched characters count as 10 points. User wants to accumulate
		   the highest score possible.

End game condition: The game ends after 30 seconds.

What doesn't work: Highscore not saved --> need to create algorithm to save highscore even after game is closed.
